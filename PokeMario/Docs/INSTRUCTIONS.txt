Welcome! These are the instructions to enjoy the game:

    You are pikachu, who landed in the mario-verse
    by a glitch in the pokeball!

    It's your goal to reach the pokecenters after
    defeating all the other pokemons. But be
    careful, some can't be defeated and they just
    have to be avoided! Also, there are pits, so
    watch your step!

    You get 2 lives in total to make it through
    the 2 stages.

    To lend you a hand, Professor Oak has sent
    special thunderstones which temporarily evolve
    you into Raichu for 5 seconds, during which
    you turn invinvible to all damage!

Good Luck!
